# Collatz Conjecture Analysis Project

This project is an exploration of the intriguing Collatz Conjecture, a problem in mathematics that, despite its simple formulation, remains unsolved. The project includes a suite of Python tools for generating, visualizing, analyzing, and exporting sequences related to the conjecture.

## What is the Collatz Conjecture?

The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the "3x+1 problem", is a hypothesis in mathematics that concerns sequences formed by the following process:

1. Start with any positive integer `n`.
2. If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
3. If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4. Continue this process with each new value of `n`.

The conjecture asserts that no matter which positive integer you start with, this process will always reach 1.

## Features

- **Sequence Generation**: Generate various sequences including Collatz, Fibonacci, arithmetic, and geometric sequences.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize these sequences using different plot types, including standard plots and 3D visualizations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform and output statistical analysis on the generated sequences.
- **Data Exporting**: Export the sequences and analyses to CSV and Excel formats.
